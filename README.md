# Java Coding Tests

This repository contains all Java coding challenges I have worked on
for fun, job applications or hack-days.

The hope is that it will be of use for people and will save me time having to redo the same
tests over and over again

All solutions use Java 8 API along with JUNIT

### Structure

Each solution is contained as a maven module with the appropriate name and directory structure

### Build

Checkout the repository using git clone

Use `maven clean compile` to build all modules

### Tags
